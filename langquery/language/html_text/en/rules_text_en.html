<h3>General</h3>
If you aren't allowed to do it outside of Clicon, it isn't allowed at Clicon.
Clicon strives to create an environment which caters to the anime/cosplay/gaming
community culture, but would like to remind attendees that they are still
expected to be law abiding and responsible. Attendees who violate these rules
may be subject to expulsion from Clicon without refund, and may be banned from
attending all Clicon events in subsequent years.

<h3>Behaviour</h3>
All attendees must conduct themselves with proper decorum. Attendees must behave
respectfully towards individuals from other groups attending events being held
at the Palais des congr�s as well as Clicon staff and venue representatives.
Attendees acting disrespectfully or disruptively on the site of the convention
or any other area of the Palais des congr�s may be expelled from the Clicon
event by venue security.
<b
  >Physical violence against staff or venue personnel will not be tolerated and
  will result in immediate expulsion and permanent ban from the event.</b
>

Any activities deemed to be nuisances to Clicon or the venue, including but not
limited to excessive noise or behaviour considered generally disruptive,
dangerous, or damaging, will result in expulsion from the venue and the event by
security and may result in further civil and criminal liability. Laser pointers,
laser-aiming devices, or similar devices, may not be used in public, unless you
are officially sanctioned to lead or present an Clicon seminar, workshop,
display, or other Clicon-sanctioned event in which a laser is needed. In the
interest of respecting the rights of people who want to be left alone, the
following behaviours are considered unacceptable without prior consent of the
recipient: hugging, glomping, back-slapping, kissing or other unwanted physical
contact. This also includes unwanted advances or other similar forms of
behaviour considered to be harassment.

<h3>Badges</h3>
<b>Badges must be worn, visible and accessible at all times.</b> Badges should
be positioned forward-facing around chest height. If the badge cannot be
displayed at chest height due to costume restrictions or other issues, please
make sure to display it as prominently and visibly as possible.
<b
  >Cosplayers may temporarily conceal them for the purpose of photos, but must
  keep their badge visible for the remainder of the time.</b
>

Attendees who do not have their badges properly displayed may be refused access
to Clicon activities and/or be escorted off site. All participants must carry a
picture ID at all times and must produce it when requested by Clicon staff or
venue security. Participants who have lost their badge must report the loss as
soon as possible to the registration desk. Lost badges should be returned to the
registration desk. If your lost badge is recovered, you may pick it up at the
registration desk upon presentation of photo ID.

<h3>Sales</h3>
The sale or solicitation of any type of goods or services on Clicon premises
without prior permission and arrangements with Clicon staff is strictly
prohibited. This rule will be strictly enforced. Violation will result in
expulsion from Clicon and possibly the venue by Clicon staff and/or venue
security. This rule applies universally to all guests, dealers, and attendees.

weapons policy. Sharp or metal weapons may only be sold if they are immediately

props must be peace bonded immediately by Clicon's weapons master. Clicon, its
organizers and the venue reserve the right to restrict any participant from
selling weapons. Unlicensed reproductions of copyrighted works (ie: "bootlegs",
"fansubs", "Hong Kong versions", etc.) may not be offered for sale. This
includes video tapes, CDs, DVDs, Blu-rays, computer software, collectibles,
apparel or printed artwork not produced under license by the original copyright
holder, or any other unlawful reproduction of works. If it is not visibly
authentic, don't bring it. The sale and display of explicit material to minors
is strictly forbidden. Sellers may have a sign indicating adult materials are
available, but they must be kept out of sight and restricted from minors.
Additional lighting and sound equipment is permitted in the Exhibition Hall on
the condition that it does not interfere with other participants. Any devices
that produce noise or other disruption, including megaphones, sirens, strobe
lights and horns are prohibited. Yelling, hawking or other aggressive
solicitation of customers is also prohibited. Sellers are responsible for
collection of taxes and acquisition of any applicable permits and licenses. Only
original, personal fan works created by the selling artist may be sold in the
Artists' Area. The sale of commercial goods such as video tapes, CDs, DVDs,
Blu-rays, posters, scrolls, pens, etc., is prohibited unless you or the group
you represent are the copyright owner or licensors of said works. The
advertising of any such restricted goods or services is also forbidden.
Violation will lead to expulsion from the Artists' Area.
