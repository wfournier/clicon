<h2>Otakuthon 2017 Registration Policies</h2>
<p>
  Please take a moment to read the convention rules and policies on our website
  or in the program booklet. By registering, you agree to comply with
  Otakuthon's rules and policies. Failure to follow the rules may result in loss
  of badge and expulsion from the convention grounds without refund.
</p>
<h3>1. Refund Policy</h3>
<p>
  <strong
    >Registrations are non-refundable -- this includes badges as well as any
    paid extras (ex: concert tickets, T-shirts, etc.).</strong
  >&nbsp;Badges may not be resold.
</p>
<h3>2. Price and Payment</h3>
<p>
  Registrations must be paid in full before the respective registration
  deadlines to benefit from the reduced rate, if applicable. Any registration
  not paid before the end of the respective registration period will lose the
  reduced rate or be cancelled.
</p>
<p>
  Mail-in payments must be postmarked on or before the respective deadline and
  must be received no later than one week after the deadline. Otakuthon will not
  be responsible for any payments that may be lost through mail. Please
  do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;send cash through the mail -- we accept
  cheques and money orders via mail.
</p>
<p>
  Single-day badges can only be purchased on the same day on the convention site
  (ex: a Saturday-only badge can only be purchased on that Saturday).
</p>
<h3>3. Badge Pickup</h3>
<p>
  Badges must be picked up during
  <a href="/clicon/Information.php#hours">Otakuthon 2017 registration hours</a>
  at the Palais des congr√®s in the registration area. Badges
  will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;be mailed or issued otherwise.
</p>
<p>
  To pick up your badge, you will need a copy of your
  <strong>registration confirmation</strong> (printed or digital copy) with a
  <strong>valid photo ID</strong> (ex: student card, Opus card, driver's
  license, Medicare, etc). Please be sure that the information provided in the
  registration system is correct (ex: first name, last name, birth date, etc.),
  as this information will be matched against the valid photo ID you provide
  when you pick up your badge.&nbsp; Staff reserve the right to withhold badges
  from individuals whose information provided does not match with the valid
  photo ID provided.
</p>
<p>
  Each attendee must come in person and present a valid photo ID in order to
  pick up his/her own badge. The account owner has no pickup rights to the
  attendee badges listed under him/her. However, the account owner can update
  badge information until <strong>July 28, 2017</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >Information on your valid photo ID must match the information you have
    entered.</strong

    >The account owner can pick up his/her own badge ONLY. &nbsp;</span
  >Only the participant whose name matches may pick up the corresponding badge.

</p>
<h3>4. Child Registration</h3>
<p>
  Children under the age of 11 and under born after&nbsp;<strong
    >July 31, 2005&nbsp;</strong
  >must always be registered under a legal guardian. Otakuthon staff and
  volunteers are not responsible for taking care of children. The guardian is
  responsible for keeping their child under supervision.
</p>
<p>
  All children of age 11 and under&nbsp;<strong>must present a valid ID</strong
  >&nbsp;(ex: birth certificate, health insurance card, passport, etc.) as proof
  of age.
</p>
<h3>5. Lost and Found Badges</h3>
<p>
  Found badges may be claimed upon presentation of a valid photo ID at
  registration. Lost badges will be replaced at a fee equal to the at-door
  registration rate.
</p>
<h3>6. Badge Policy</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Badges must be worn, visible and accessible at all times.</strong
  >&nbsp;Badges should be positioned forward-facing around chest height. If the
  badge cannot be displayed at chest height due to costume restrictions or other
  issues, please make sure to display it as prominently and visibly as possible.
  Cosplayers may temporarily conceal them for the purpose of photos, but must
  keep their badge visible for the remainder of the time.
</p>
<p>
  Attendees who do not have their badges properly displayed may be refused
  access to Otakuthon activities and/or be escorted off site.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >All participants must carry a valid photo ID at all times and must produce
    it when requested by Otakuthon staff or venue security</strong
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Participants who have lost their badge must report the loss as soon as
  possible to the registration desk.&nbsp; Lost badges should be returned to the
  registration desk. If your lost badge is recovered, you may pick it up at the
  registration desk upon presentation of a valid photo ID.
</p>
<h3>7. Information Accuracy</h3>
<p>
  Attendees must provide complete and accurate registration information.
  Registration information must correspond with information on the valid photo
  ID used to pick up their badge. Staff reserve the right to withhold badges
  from individuals whose information provided does not match with the valid
  photo ID provided. Otakuthon will not be held responsible in the event that an
  attendee cannot be contacted with the provided information.
